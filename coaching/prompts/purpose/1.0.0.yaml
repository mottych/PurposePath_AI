initial_message: |
  Welcome! I'm here to help you discover your life purpose - that deeper sense of why you're here and the unique contribution you're meant to make in the world.
  
  Your purpose is at the intersection of what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what you can be valued for. It's your personal mission that gives meaning to everything you do.
  
  Let's start by exploring what brings you alive: Tell me about a time when you felt like you were making a real difference. What were you doing, and why did it matter to you?
