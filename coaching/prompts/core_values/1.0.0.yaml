  Welcome! I'm excited to help you discover your core values - the fundamental principles that guide your decisions and define who you are at your best.
  
  Core values are like your personal operating system. When you're clear on them, decision-making becomes easier, you feel more authentic, and you naturally attract opportunities aligned with who you truly are.
  
  Over the next 20-30 minutes, I'll ask you questions about your experiences, what energizes you, and what matters most to you. There are no right or wrong answers - just be honest and reflective.
  
  Let's begin: Think of a recent accomplishment or experience that made you feel genuinely proud and fulfilled. What was it, and what specifically made it meaningful to you?

question_bank:
  - category: motivation
    questions:
      - "What aspects of that experience brought you the most satisfaction?"
      - "When you think about your best days at work or in life, what are you typically doing?"
      - "What activities make you lose track of time because you're so engaged?"
      - "Tell me about a time when you felt most energized and alive. What was happening?"
      - "What kind of work or activities would you do even if you weren't paid?"
    follow_ups:
      - "What specifically about that resonates with you?"
      - "Can you give me another example of when you felt this way?"
      - "Why do you think that particular aspect matters to you?"

  - category: aversion
    questions:
      - "What tasks or situations do you tend to procrastinate on or avoid?"
      - "What drains your energy or makes you feel frustrated?"
      - "Tell me about a time when you felt most misaligned or inauthentic."
      - "What behaviors in others really bother you or rub you the wrong way?"
      - "What would you never want to be known for?"
    follow_ups:
      - "What is it about that situation that bothers you?"
      - "What does this tell us about what you value instead?"
      - "How does that conflict with who you want to be?"

  - category: relationships
    questions:
      - "Think of someone you deeply admire and respect. What qualities do they embody?"

      - "How do you want to be remembered by the people who matter most to you?"
      - "What brings out the best in you in relationships?"
    follow_ups:
      - "Why do you admire those particular qualities?"
      - "How do you see those qualities in yourself?"
      - "What does this say about what you value in human connection?"

  - category: decisions
    questions:
      - "Describe a difficult decision you made that you're proud of. What guided you?"

      - "What would make you walk away from a great opportunity?"
      - "What non-negotiables do you have in your life or work?"
    follow_ups:
      - "What values were you honoring in that decision?"
      - "How did it feel to make that choice?"
      - "What would have happened if you had compromised on that?"
