## 1. Executive Summary

The Business Foundation module reimagines the current onboarding experience, transforming it from a one-time wizard into a living strategic asset. Users can complete an initial guided setup, then return anytime to view and edit individual sections without navigating the entire flow.

The enhanced data model captures richer information about the business, enabling more meaningful AI suggestions throughout the application. Products gain full descriptions, values include implementation guidance, and new sections provide crucial business context.

### Key Transformations

| Current State | Future State |
|--------------|--------------|
| Onboarding wizard only | Hub + Wizard dual access |
| Products: Title + Problem | Products: Full profile with features |
| Values: Just names | Values: Name + Meaning + Implementation |
| Limited business context | Rich profile for AI context |
| Complete and forget | Living, evolving document |

---

## 2. Problem Statement

### Challenge 1: Inflexible Access Pattern
Users must navigate the entire wizard to change a single piece of information. A CEO who wants to update their company's vision must click through multiple irrelevant steps, creating friction and discouraging refinement.

### Challenge 2: Shallow Product Information
Products currently capture only a title and the problem they solve. Missing is what the product actually does, its features, target audience, and differentiators. This limits our ability to provide relevant strategic suggestions.

### Challenge 3: Insufficient Business Context
The application lacks fundamental business context needed for meaningful AI suggestions:
- Industry classification
- Company stage and size
- Revenue range
- Geographic focus

Without this context, AI suggestions remain generic rather than tailored.

### Challenge 4: Values Without Depth
Core values are captured as a simple list of words. Users type "Innovation" or "Integrity" without articulating what these mean in practice or how they will be implemented. This makes values feel like empty platitudes rather than actionable principles.

### Challenge 5: One-Time Mentality
The "onboarding" terminology implies completion. Once done, users rarely return, even as their business evolves. The foundation becomes stale and disconnected from reality.

---

## 3. Goals and Objectives

### Primary Goals

1. **Enable Direct Access**: Users can view and edit any section of their business foundation independently, without navigating unrelated sections.

2. **Enrich Data Quality**: Capture deeper, more actionable information in every section, transforming shallow data into strategic assets.

3. **Provide AI Context**: Give the AI system enough business context to provide tailored, industry-specific, stage-appropriate suggestions.

4. **Encourage Ongoing Refinement**: Design the experience to invite regular review and updates as the business evolves.

### Success Criteria

- Users with complete foundations: 80% within 30 days
- Return visits to foundation: 40% of users within first quarter
- AI suggestion relevance score improvement: 25%
- Foundation health score average: 75%+

| `website` | `profile.website` | Direct copy (if exists) |
| `vision` | `identity.vision` | Direct copy |
| `purpose` | `identity.purpose` | Direct copy |
| `coreValues[]` (string array) | `identity.values[]` | Create CoreValue entries with name only; meaning and implementation flagged as incomplete |
| `niche` | `market.nicheStatement` | Direct copy |
| `ica` | `market.icas[0]` | Create single ICA entry with demographics field; other fields flagged as incomplete |
| `valueProposition` | `proposition.uniqueSellingProposition` | Direct copy |

- Business Model: Entire section (new)

### 10.2 Migration Strategy

1. **Automatic migration** on first access to new Foundation Hub
2. **Preserve all existing data** - no data loss
3. **Flag incomplete fields** - guide users to enhance with health score indicators
4. **No forced re-entry** - existing data is sufficient to continue using the application
5. **Graceful degradation** - AI features work with partial data, improve with more context

### 10.3 User Communication

- Toast notification: "We've enhanced the Business Foundation. Take a moment to review."
- Email for major updates
- In-app guide highlighting new capabilities
