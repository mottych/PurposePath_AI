# Shared Documentation

This folder is synchronized across PurposePath repositories by the Sync Shared Documentation workflow.

Contents here should be generic, reusable specs or shared guidance. Edits on dev will propagate to other repos when the workflow runs.

Last synced seed note: ensure every repo keeps this folder under version control so future edits propagate consistently.
